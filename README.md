This program is to calculate K-Nearest Neighbour from scratch and do not use any built-in function to calculate.
From the provided training dataset and testing dataset, first, the program excludes the training dataset from the class column.
With the rest of the training dataset and the testing dataset, the program calculates the Euclidean distances. For testing purpose, we take only one row from the testing dataset as a test dataset. Then the program merges and sorts this Euclidean distance with the provided training dataset. By the value of K, the program takes the closest neighbours and checks the value of Class.
