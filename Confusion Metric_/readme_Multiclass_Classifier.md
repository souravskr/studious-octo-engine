This Python3 function calculates for a multi-class classifier (number of classes > 2) the
following classification performance metrics: the overall accuracy and, for each class: precision, recall,
specificity and FDR. This  program that 1) reads a multi-class confusion matrix
given as a tab-delimited text file, and 2) outputs in the standard output (i.e., the terminal), the overall
accuracy and then for each class, the class label and its performance metrics (tabs should separate one class per line, the class label and performance metrics). The program runs on Linux and takes
one command-line argument: the name of the file containing the confusion matrix.
